# WAIFU-WEBUI 🌸✨

A Gradio web UI for Low Res Waifu Models. 🖼️

## Requirements 🛠️

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pillow gradio  # 🔧
```

## Usage 🚀

Run `python app.py` 💻 to start the demo interface. The script will launch a
local Gradio server with a simple navigation menu. Choose the **Upscale** tab
to upload an image and view the **simple** ✨ upscaled result. 🎉

The interface presents three tabs—*Home*, *Upscale*, and *About*—allowing quick
navigation. The **Upscale** button doubles the size of your image using a
placeholder algorithm.
